### hello, I'm sarah! 👋🏽🧛

I am a computer science student at University of San Francisco ([USF](https://www.usfca.edu/)). I work on VR research at the Human Computer Interaction lab. I am also a program manager and president of [Women in Tech](https://www.instagram.com/wit_usf/) at USF. 

- 🔥 I'm interested in software engineering roles that value thoughtful system design and analysis (read my silly design doc for my last data structures project [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1gr9q0P_DtmPgl-iQuNt3yfUrdtElNZqYQVVzw1qa7v0/edit)
- 🌎 I would love work on software development for edu/public/climate tech (Hit me up iTalki, Duolingo, Udemy, Google Classroom 👀)
- 🍞🥖🥯🥐I enjoy eating bread
- 🧵 And on the rare occasions that I have free time, I sew costumes and learn Arabic
- 🧿 hatsh3p is a play on [Hatshepsut](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hatshepsut) and a reference who I am as an Egyptian-American and nonbinary person (I use she/they pronouns)
